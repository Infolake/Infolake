## üåå **Primary Research: Geometrodynamics of Entropy (GoE)**

I am the author of the **Geometrodynamics of Entropy (GoE)**, a first-principles theory of physics that posits a (3+3)-dimensional spacetime. From a minimal set of axioms, GoE derives the Standard Model gauge group, the fermion mass hierarchy, and resolves the core paradoxes of modern cosmology.

The complete theory, validation scripts, and computational framework are available in the main repository:

| Prediction / Result | GoE's Explanation & Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Muon `g-2` & `Œ¥_CP` Unification** | The two anomalies are unified by a single geometric constant, **`K ‚âà 1.9 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ`**. This correlation is statistically validated (‚úÖ) against experimental data. |
| **Fermion Mass Hierarchy** | Masses are derived as eigenvalues of a **Geometric Mass Matrix** whose elements are the energy modes of the temporal fibres. Reconstructs all 12 masses with `<0.1%` error (‚úÖ). |
| **JWST "Impossible" Galaxies** | A singularity-free **Cosmological Bounce**, driven by temporal torsion, seeds early structure formation, perfectly matching JWST observations (‚úÖ). |
| **Dark Matter/Energy** | Explained as the macroscopic gravitational and energetic effects of the temporal fibres themselves, eliminating the need for new particles or a cosmological constant (‚úÖ). |
| **Quantum Stability** | The theory is proven to be **ghost-free**, ensuring a unitary and causal quantum framework (‚úÖ). |

### üìù **Featured Publication: A Geometric Foundation for Quantum Computing**

This paper applies the GoE framework to solve the central problem of decoherence in quantum computing, proposing a new path toward fault-tolerant hardware.

> **Abstract:** We derive a model for decoherence as the topological degradation of a qubit's geometric state. Our results predict that topological qubits based on Majorana zero modes can achieve coherence times of **~4.4 seconds**‚Äîan improvement of over four orders of magnitude‚Äîby leveraging the non-local information storage within GoE's temporal fibres.

## üè• **Professional Work: AI in Healthcare & Emergency Medicine**

As a practicing emergency physician, I have led data science initiatives to solve critical public health challenges. I am currently developing AI-driven solutions to transition healthcare from a reactive to a proactive model.

### **Leadership: COES-SC COVID-19 Strategic Response (2020-2022)**
*   **Led the Data Science team** for the Santa Catarina State Health Emergency Operations Center (COES-SC).
*   Unified researchers and specialists to develop **predictive models for hospital capacity and viral spread**.
*   Our work directly informed state policy, leading to strategic lockdowns and interventions that made Santa Catarina's response a **benchmark of success in Brazil**.

### **Current: AI Agent Development at MedSuite**
*   Developing **proactive care AI agents** that use real-time, multi-modal health data to predict patient deterioration before it becomes critical.
*   Bridging my frontline emergency medicine expertise with cutting-edge AI to build systems that save lives.

```python
# Conceptual Pipeline: Proactive Care AI
from medsuite.ai import ProactiveCareAgent

agent = ProactiveCareAgent(patient_id="123")
risk_score = agent.analyze_realtime_data()

if risk_score > agent.clinical_threshold:
    agent.trigger_intervention_protocol()
    # E.g., Alert medical team, suggest specific tests, or adjust medication.
```

## üß† **Philosophy & Methodology**

> *"Time is not a dimension we move through, but a multidimensional manifold we exist within. Understanding its true nature is the key to unifying all of physics."*

My work is driven by a cross-domain methodology. The same principles of **Bayesian inference, predictive modeling, and rigorous statistical validation** that I used to model a pandemic are applied to test the parameters of the cosmos. Emergency medicine teaches pattern recognition under pressure; data science provides the tools to quantify it. Theoretical physics demands both.
